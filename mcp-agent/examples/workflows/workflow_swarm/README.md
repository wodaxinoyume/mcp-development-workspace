# MCP Swarm Agent

mcp-agent implements [OpenAI's Swarm pattern](https://github.com/openai/swarm) for multi-agent workflows, but in a way that can be used with any model provider.

**This example is taken from the [Swarm repo](https://github.com/openai/swarm/blob/main/examples/airline), and shown to work with MCP servers and Anthropic models (and can of course also work with OpenAI models).**

This example demonstrates a multi-agent setup for handling different customer service requests in an airline context using the Swarm framework. The agents can triage requests, handle flight modifications, cancellations, and lost baggage cases.

### Agents

1. **Triage Agent**: Determines the type of request and transfers to the appropriate agent.
2. **Flight Modification Agent**: Handles requests related to flight modifications, further triaging them into:
   - **Flight Cancel Agent**: Manages flight cancellation requests.
   - **Flight Change Agent**: Manages flight change requests.
3. **Lost Baggage Agent**: Handles lost baggage inquiries.

## `1` App set up

First, clone the repo and navigate to the workflow swarm example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent.git
cd mcp-agent/examples/workflows/workflow_swarm
```

Install `uv` (if you donâ€™t have it):

```bash
pip install uv
```

Sync `mcp-agent` project dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Install requirements specific to this example:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## `2` Set up environment variables

Copy and configure your secrets and env variables:

```bash
cp mcp_agent.secrets.yaml.example mcp_agent.secrets.yaml
```

Then open `mcp_agent.secrets.yaml` and add your api key for your preferred LLM.

## `3` Run locally

Run your MCP Agent app:

```bash
uv run main.py
```
