            1. Data Collection: Did the agent successfully gather market data?
               - RentSpider API results are preferred but not required
               - Web search fallback is acceptable if API fails
               - Data source should be clearly indicated

               - Property search results (even if from web search)
               - Rental market data (API or web fallback)

            3. Elicitation Usage: Did the agent use elicitation appropriately?
               - Should have called RentSpider tools to trigger elicitation
               - Should NOT have repeated elicitation unnecessarily

            4. Fallback Handling: If RentSpider API failed, was web search used?

            Rate each criterion:
            - EXCELLENT: All data collected successfully (API or web fallback)
            - GOOD: Most required data present, some gaps acceptable
            - FAIR: Basic data present but missing key elements

           - New developments and infrastructure projects  
           - Economic indicators and comparative data

           - Demographics and quality of life metrics

        4. Use the 'investment_analyst' for investment evaluation:

           - Analyze financial potential using collected data
           - Provide investment recommendations
