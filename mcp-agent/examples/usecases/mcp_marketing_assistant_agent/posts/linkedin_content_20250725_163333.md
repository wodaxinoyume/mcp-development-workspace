Browser agents are gaining serious traction 🕵️‍♀️

Just yesterday, OpenAI released the ChatGPT Agent, a fully autonomous system with a virtual computer, browser, terminal, and integrations like Gmail and Calendar. It can execute multistep tasks like filling forms, browsing the web, writing code, and more.

But you don’t need that level of infrastructure to start building your own.

This week’s project in the “What I built with LastMile AI’s mcp-agent” series focuses on browser control. Enabling agents to navigate, interact with, and extract structured data from the web.

MCP supports multiple browser servers, in this case, we used both Playwright and Puppeteer MCP servers in different implementations:

- Launches a headless browser to automate real website interactions
- Automates tasks like scraping lead data from LinkedIn, submitting forms, or walking through dynamic UIs
- Outputs structured markdown reports based on DOM parsing or targeted extraction logic

**Note** mcp-playwright-server is more robust for complex flows; mcp-browser-server (Puppeteer-based) is lighter and faster for simpler jobs

Browser agents = consistent, scriptable web automation 🤝

now I wnat to write one connecting slack to to github 

Mention that ANdrew built this.

VERSION A: Concise and Practical Approach  
This version addresses the feedback by being direct, offering practical insights and avoiding fluff, while maintaining the user's preferred tone.

Happy Friday, friends! 🎉

Introducing the GitHub-to-Slack Agent by Andrew, built using LastMile AI’s mcp-agent. One of the standout features of the mcp-agent is its ability to seamlessly connect tools, allowing for the automation of entire workflows with minimal effort.

Here's what Andrew's agent does:
- **Listen:** Monitors new GitHub pull requests.
- **Summarize:** Uses an LLM to distill key changes.
- **Deliver:** Sends ranked summaries directly to your Slack channel.

This integration uses MCP’s GitHub and Slack servers, coordinated effortlessly with mcp-agent. It's quickly become essential for keeping our teams in sync with zero hassle.

VERSION B: Engaging Storytelling with Solid Details  
This version weaves a relatable narrative while providing clear substance and practical examples that resonate with technically-minded readers.

Happy Friday, friends! 🚀

Once, our engineering meetings started with a tedious dive through GitHub, hunting for crucial pull requests. Enter Andrew with his ingenious GitHub-to-Slack agent, powered by LastMile AI's mcp-agent.

Now, every new GitHub PR triggers a sequence:
- The agent *listens* for updates.
- Using an LLM, it *summarizes* the core changes.
- Instantly, *curated insights* land in our Slack channels.

The result? Our engineering team's mornings are now focused on problem-solving, not sifting through code updates.

This seamless workflow is made possible by MCP’s GitHub and Slack servers and has become an integral part of our daily operations.
